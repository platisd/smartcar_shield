# Smartcar shield CAD files

### Description
Here you can find the files necessary in order to edit or manufacture the Smartcar shield PCB. The files can be opened using CAD software, such as Eagle PCB that is free for personal use and KiCad, which is open source. The .sch file includes the logical schematic of the circuit, that is how the various components are connected to each other and the .brd file illustrates how they will be printed on the actual board.

All components that are needed for the board, are through-hole, for easy soldering. Finally, feel free to edit or redistribute the shield. Pull requests are always welcome.

### Order a PCB
If you do not want to bother with CAD softwareand just want to buy the PCBs for the shield, I have uploaded the necessary files in two popular services, [OSH-Park](https://oshpark.com/) (USA) and [PCBWay](https://www.pcbway.com/) (China), so they can be purchased with a few clicks.

**Note: I am not affiliated with either of these services, however I do receive a 10% commission in coupons from [PCBway](https://www.pcbway.com/) when you order the boards from them.**
