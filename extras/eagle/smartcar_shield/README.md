# Smartcar shield CAD files

### Description
Here you can find the files necessary in order to edit or manufacture the Smartcar shield PCB. The files can be opened using CAD software, such as Eagle PCB that is free for personal use and KiCad, which is open source. The board was designed using Eagle PCB version 7.x.x and therefore it is the recommended software to be used in order to ensure maximum compatibility. The .sch file includes the logical schematic of the circuit, that is how the various components are connected to each other and the .brd file illustrates how they will be printed on the actual board.

All components that are needed for the board, are through-hole, for easy soldering. Finally, feel free to edit or redistribute the shield. Pull requests are always welcome.

### Order a PCB
If you do not want to bother with CAD softwareand just want to buy the PCBs for the shield, I have uploaded the necessary files in two popular services, [OSH-Park](https://oshpark.com/) (USA) and [Seeed Studio](http://www.seeedstudio.com/) (China), so they can be purchased with a few clicks. Usually, you will receive the boards from OSH-Park slightly faster than Seeed Studio, however it is more expensive if you want to order more than 3 boards.

**Note: I am in no way affiliated with either of them, nor receive any profit from the boards you might order.**

* [OSH-Park](https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/PneNeqwy) (rev. 1)
* [Seeed Studio](http://www.seeedstudio.com/service/rQ94NKC8) (rev. 1)

Seeed Studio's service, does not render Eagle 7.x.x files properly for the time being, so it cannot generate a preview of the board. Because of that, in the field "PCB dimension" you have to manually choose: 5cm Max * 10cm Max. Despite the problems in rendering, the PCB will be printed out as it should.
